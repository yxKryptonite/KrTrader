# KrTrader: A Toy Quantitative Trading System

![](assets/logo.png)

[中文](Chinese.md)

## Introduction

A toy quantitative trading system based on Python. (still under development)

As a sophomore student majoring in CS, I've never systematically learnt any financial knowledge before (only with one general course). So based on my shallow knowledge, I developed this toy trading system within limited stock pool, using simple signal strategies and some machine learning based algorithms (which is my strength).

The trading details may be shallow and childish, but I'm dedicated to the development of the `model-wrapped strategies` designing patterns, which is the core of this project.

## Features
- [x] Model-wrapped strategies
  
  👉 You can easily design your own strategies based on a [BaseStrategy](https://github.com/yxKryptonite/KrTrader/blob/master/krtrader/strategies/base.py) template by wrapping your model into a strategy class.
- [x] Machine learning based algorithms
  
  👉 You can design your models for trading based on a [BaseModel](https://github.com/yxKryptonite/KrTrader/blob/master/krtrader/models/base.py) template, using PyTorch.
- [x] Simulated trading & backtesting
  
  👉 No explanation needed!
- [x] Unified configuration frameworks
  
  👉 You can use a unified configuration for all tasks in this project, including training, inferencing, backtesting... see [template.yaml](https://github.com/yxKryptonite/KrTrader/blob/master/config/template.yaml) for more details.
- [x] Nice plotting
  
  👉 Based on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), you can plot the trading details in a nice way.
- [x] Crawling of alternative data
  
  👉 Based on [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io), you can crawl alternative data from yahoo finance, sina finance, etc.
- [x] Natural language processing
  
  👉 Based on [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), you can extract features from the news for stock predictions.
- [ ] To be continued...

## Getting Started

## Usage

Tip: all the following commands are run in the root directory of the project.

- Trade using `strategies`
- Wrapping `models` with `strategies`
  - Train models
    ```bash
    python3 krtrader/train.py --yaml config/stock_train.yaml
    ```
  - Inference models
    ```bash
    python3 krtrader/backtest.py --yaml config/stock_inference.yaml
    ```
