# KrTrader: A Toy Quantitative Trading System

![](assets/logo.png)

[ä¸­æ–‡](Chinese.md)

## Introduction

A toy quantitative trading system based on Python.

As a sophomore student majoring in CS, I've never systematically learnt financial knowledge before (except for one general course). So based on my shallow knowledge, I developed this toy trading system **from scratch** within limited stock pool, using simple signal strategies and some machine learning based algorithms (which is my strength).

The trading details may be primitive or imperfect, but I'm dedicated to the development of the `model-wrapped strategies` designing patterns, which is the core of this project.

## Features
- [x] Model-wrapped strategies
  
  ðŸ‘‰ You can easily design your own strategies based on a [BaseStrategy](https://github.com/yxKryptonite/KrTrader/blob/master/krtrader/strategies/base.py) template by wrapping your model into a strategy class.
- [x] Machine learning based algorithms
  
  ðŸ‘‰ You can design your models for trading based on a [BaseModel](https://github.com/yxKryptonite/KrTrader/blob/master/krtrader/models/base.py) template, using PyTorch.
- [x] Simulated trading & backtesting
  
  ðŸ‘‰ No explanation needed!
- [x] Unified configuration frameworks
  
  ðŸ‘‰ You can use a unified configuration for all tasks in this project, including training, inferencing, backtesting... see [template.yaml](https://github.com/yxKryptonite/KrTrader/blob/master/config/template.yaml) for more details.
- [x] Nice plotting
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Based on [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), you can plot the trading details in a nice way.
- [x] Crawling of alternative data
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Based on [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io), you can crawl alternative data from yahoo finance, sina finance, etc.
- [x] Natural language processing
  
  ðŸ‘‰ Based on [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), you can extract features from the news for stock predictions.
